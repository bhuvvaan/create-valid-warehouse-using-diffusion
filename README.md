# Creating valid warehouses

This repo contains code that creates warehouse environments using diffusion models that follow certain rules as mentioned in the report. It uses huggingface APIs to train a diffusion model from scratch. The code also generates its own training data. The code is a simple Jupyter notebook that can be run directly.

```dfs.py``` can also be run independently for changing the dimensions of the warehouse.

```chain_of_thought.py``` will require an OpenAI API key.
